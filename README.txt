Hello, I just want to say that these are just my outputs to my exercises
that I have done in the textbooks that I have.

There's no element of creativity and something here, it's just an exercises.

I hope that I master all of these in order to step up my game to become an Robotics engineer.

I will recreate all of these exercises in C++, Python, and Java.

Credits to 'Let Us C by Y.P.Kanethar' for these exercises.

Kudos!
